The Car Dashboard Management System is a web-based application designed to simplify the management of car-related information. The system allows users to add, display, update, and manage car details in an easy-to-use interface, providing functionality that is efficient and user-friendly.

The application leverages JSP (JavaServer Pages) and Servlets for dynamic content generation and processing user requests. A MySQL database is used for storing car details, including model, brand, color, and price, making the system capable of handling large amounts of data efficiently.
